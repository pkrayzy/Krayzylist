Create your ad blocklist using Cloudflare Gateway

### How to set this up?

   1. `Account.Zero Trust : Edit` 
   2. `Account.Account Firewall Access Rules : Edit`

Note from [@minlaxz](https://github.com/minlaxz):
1. Domain list style: I personally preferred second one in blacklist styles, which has more readablity and concise.
2. Dynamic domain list: You can also update your dynamic (fluid) whitelist and blacklist using [dynamic_blacklist.txt](./lists/dynamic_blacklist.txt) and [dynamic_whitelist.txt](./lists/dynamic_whitelist.txt)
3. Deprected using `.env` : Setting sensitive information inside a public repository is considered too dangerous use-case, since any unwanted person could easily steal your Cloudflare credentials from that `.env` file.
